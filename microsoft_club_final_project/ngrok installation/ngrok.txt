# How to deploy ngrok for a Streamlit app

1. Install ngrok
   - Download ngrok from the official website: https://ngrok.com/download
   - Unzip it and place it in a known folder (e.g., C:\ngrok on Windows)

2. Install Streamlit
   - Make sure you have Python installed
   - Open terminal/command prompt and run:
     pip install streamlit

3. Create your Streamlit app
   - Example: save this as app.py
     import streamlit as st

     st.title("My Streamlit App with ngrok")
     st.write("Hello, this is running via ngrok!")

4. Start Streamlit locally
   - Run in terminal:
     streamlit run app.py
   - Streamlit will show a local URL like http://localhost:8501

5. Start ngrok to expose Streamlit
   - Open another terminal and navigate to ngrok folder
   - Run:
     ./ngrok http 8501   # On Windows use: ngrok.exe http 8501
   - ngrok will provide a public URL like:
     https://abcd1234.ngrok.io

6. Access your Streamlit app
   - Open the public ngrok URL in any browser
   - Your app is now live online

7. Optional: authtoken
   - Sign up on ngrok website
   - Get your auth token
   - Run:
     ngrok config add-authtoken <your_token>
   - This allows longer sessions and custom subdomains

# Notes
- Always download ngrok from the official website to avoid malware.
- Close ngrok when done to stop exposing your local machine.
